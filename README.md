**Comprehensive Guide to Backup and Restore PostgreSQL Database Utilizing Google Drive Storage**

This guide details the use of two Python scripts: `backup.py` and `restore.py` for the purpose of backing up and restoring databases. The `backup.py` script is responsible for creating a **PostgreSQL dump**, which it achieves by zipping and encrypting the specified database. Once encrypted, the dump is uploaded to **Google Drive Storage** for safekeeping. On the other hand, the `restore.py` script locates the most recent dump in **Google Drive Storage**, downloads it, and subsequently unzips and decrypts the data. Once decrypted, the data is then loaded back into the **PostgreSQL** database.

To effectively use both scripts, you'll need:

- A version of Python3.6 or higher,
- The pip packages installed from the `requirements.txt` file,
- The Google Drive API and a Service Account enabled with the appropriate roles and permissions,
- Files with public (`backup_key.pem.pub`) and private (`backup_key.pem`) keys for encrypting and decrypting the dump, which can be generated with openssl:

```bash
openssl req -x509 -nodes -days 1000000 -newkey rsa:4096 -keyout backup_key.pem\\
-subj "/C=US/ST=Illinois/L=Chicago/O=IT/CN=[www.example.com](<http://www.example.com/>)" \\
-out backup_key.pem.pub

```

- A file with the PostgreSQL database password (`~/.pgpass`) set with `chmod 600`, including, for example:

```
localhost:5432:your_database:your_db_user:your_db_user_password

```

- Finally, ensure to check the `check_hostname()` function in the `restore.py` script. This function checks the `hostname` of the current server, serving as a safeguard against potentially dropping database tables on the production server.

## Enabling Google Drive API

To enable the Google Drive API, follow these steps:

1. Go to the Google Cloud Console at `https://console.cloud.google.com/`.

## Google Drive Folder ID
To find the **Google Drive** folder **ID**, follow these steps:
1. Open your **Google Drive**.
2. Navigate to the folder for which you need the **ID**.
3. Click on the folder to open it.
4. Look at the **URL** in your web browser's address bar. The long string of characters at the end of the URL is the folder's **ID**.

## BACKUP

Here's how the script works:

1. **Environment Variables**: At the beginning, the script sets up several environment variables, such as the host name of the database (`DB_HOSTNAME`), the database name (`DB_NAME`), the database user (`DB_USER`), the Google Drive folder ID where the backup will be stored (`GOOGLE_DRIVE_FOLDER_ID`), and the file path to the public key used for encryption (`BACKUP_KEY_PUB_FILE`).
2. **Function Definitions**: Several functions are defined for use in the script. These include:
    - `say_hello()`: This function prints a greeting message when the script is run.
    - `get_now_datetime_str()`: This function returns the current date and time as a formatted string.
    - `check_key_file_exists()`: This function checks if the public key file for encryption exists. If it doesn't, the script exits.
    - `dump_database()`: This function uses the `pg_dump` command to create a dump of the PostgreSQL database, compresses the dump using gzip, and then encrypts the compressed dump using openssl. The encrypted dump is then saved to a temporary file.
    - `get_drive_service()`: This function creates and returns a Google Drive service client, which is used to interact with the Google Drive API.
    - `upload_dump_to_drive()`: This function uploads the encrypted database dump to Google Drive. The file metadata (including the file name and the ID of the parent Google Drive folder) and the file content are specified in the request. After the file is uploaded, the function prints the ID of the uploaded file.
    - `remove_temp_files()`: This function removes the temporary file containing the encrypted database dump.
3. **Main Program**: The main part of the script (under `if __name__ == "__main__":`) calls the functions defined above in the correct order. First, it prints a greeting message, checks if the public key file exists, creates a database dump, uploads the dump to Google Drive, and finally removes the temporary file.

## RESTORE
Here's how the script works:

1. **Environment Variables**: The script starts by setting up several environment variables, including the hostname of the database, the database name, the database user, the Google Drive folder ID where the backup is stored, and the file path to the private key used for decryption.
2. **Database Connection**: The script establishes a connection to the PostgreSQL database.
3. **Function Definitions**: The script defines several functions that are used to restore the database:
    - `say_hello()`: Prints a greeting message to the console.
    - `check_hostname()`: Checks the hostname of the current server. The script will stop execution if the hostname does not start with 'loader-' or end with '.local'.
    - `check_key_file_exists()`: Checks if the private key file for decryption exists. If not, the script stops.
    - `get_drive_service()`: Creates and returns a Google Drive service client, which is used to interact with the Google Drive API.
    - `get_last_backup_filename()`: Lists the files in the Google Drive folder and finds the most recent file, returning its name.
    - `download_s3_file(filename)`: Removes any existing file with the same name as the database dump, then downloads the specified file from Google Drive.
    - `unencrypt_database()`: Decrypts the downloaded database dump using openssl.
    - `unzip_database()`: Unzips the decrypted database dump.
    - `clear_database()`: Clears the current database state by dropping all tables.
    - `load_database()`: Loads the unzipped database dump into the PostgreSQL database.
    - `remove_temp_files()`: Removes the temporary file containing the encrypted database dump.
    - `_get_all_db_tables()`: Helper function that returns a list of all table names in the public schema of the database.
    - `_silent_remove_file(filename)`: Helper function that removes a specified file without throwing an error if the file does not exist.
4. **Main Program**: The main part of the script (under `if __name__ == "__main__":`) calls the defined functions in the correct order. It prints a greeting message, checks the hostname and if the private key file exists, downloads the most recent backup file from Google Drive, decrypts and unzips the downloaded file, clears the database, loads the unzipped dump into the database, and finally, removes the temporary file.
